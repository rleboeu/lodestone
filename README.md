## about lodestone
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lodestone was designed with the goal to be a more efficient way to download large amounts of files from the National Cancer Institute's Genomic Data Commons Data Portal (GDC Portal), making it more efficient for researchers to download items en masse (e.g. SVS files: see <a href="https://www.leicabiosystems.com/digital-pathology/manage/aperio-imagescope/">Aperio ImageScope</a>).<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to accomplish this, Lodestone utilizes the <a href="https://gdc.cancer.gov/access-data/gdc-data-transfer-tool">GDC Data Transfer Tool</a> along with Python source code. The GDC Data Transfer Tool allows for efficient download speeds, whereas Python allows for a streamlined and easy-to-modify codebase.<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lodestone is developed on Linux (Pop!\_OS and Arch), therefore Linux support will always be available. <b>Official Windows support coming soon!</b>

## prerequisites
&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>python2.7 or higher</b> (<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python3 recommended</a>).

&nbsp;&nbsp;You can check which version of python you have on OSX (Mac) or Linux by typing `python --version` or `python3 --version` into a terminal.
For Windows, it would be simpler to `right click Start -> Apps and Features -> Programs and Features` and search for the python entry.
